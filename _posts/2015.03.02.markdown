Another interesting facet of the comparison between the Minecraft world and a planet is the property of elevation. On Earth, the most common way to measure this is meters above [sea level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level). Imagine Earth as a sphere with a thin, wrinkly layer coating it. Notice that we can split up the distance from the center of the sphere to a point on the surface of the coating into *r*, the distance from the center to the inside of the coating, and *t*, the thickness of the coating at that point. This is a simplified model of how sea level works, but if *r* is really large, say around 3600 km, and *t* is pretty small (under 10km), it's easy to see why we would want to measure elevation relative to "sea level" compared to the distance from the center of the planet.

The Minecraft world may be infinite-ish in width and length, but its height is limited to 256 meters (an elevation from 0 m to 255 m). This is kind of similar to the sea level idea on Earth (though sea level in the Overworld is actually at *y*=62); we kind of *assume* there may be more planet or whatever under *y*=0, but as far as our elevation is concerned, the origin of the *y*-axis is there.
